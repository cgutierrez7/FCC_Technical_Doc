Next, each player should place their six Landmark cards facedown (under construction). This is the starting area of each player's city. Lastly each player receives 3 coins from the bank. Any excess Starting cards for a game of less than five players (Starting Establishments and Landmarks) should be returned to the box as they will not be used in the game.</p>

    <code><b>Special Note:</b> The City Hall card is considered a pre-constructed landmark. It is used as a Starting Landmark (to be used along with the Starting Establishments - Wheat Field and Bakery). Add this card to the player's Landmark section face-up (constructed); its benefit is effective as soon as the game begins. The timing for getting 1 coin is "precisely before you build" so you can use that coin to build something the same turn but are not required to do so. The City Hall card may not be demolished.</code>

    <ul>
      <li>Players earn income based on the dice roll and the effects of the Establishments that they own that match the dice roll.</li>

        </div>
      <li>It is possible that multiple types of Establishments are activated by the same die roll, in this case the Establishments are activated in the following order:
    </ul>
    
    <ol>
      <li>Restaurants (Red)</li>
      <li>Secondary Industry (Green)</li>

    <ul>
      <li>If a player owns multiple copies of a single Establishments, the effects are multiplied by the number of Establishments of that type owned.</li>
      <li><code><b>Special Note:</b> The Shopping Mall Landmark card affects each card.</code></li>
      <li>Example: a player owning multiple copies of the Bakery card would see each copy of that card earn +1 income.</li>

    <header><h1>COIN TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN PLAYERS</h1></header>
    <p>If a player owes another player money and cannot afford to pay it, they pay what they can and the rest is exempted (a player's coin total can never go below zero), the receiving player is not compensated for the lost income.</p>

    <p>As a reminder, if multiple Establishments are activated on the same die roll, Restaurant (Red) Establishments are activated first, followed by Primary/Secondary Industry (Blue/Green) and finally Major Establishments (Purple). So payment to other players is processed prior to earned income from other Establishments.</p>
    <p>If payment is owed to multiple players at the same time, payment is processed in reverse player order (counter clockwise).</p>

  <section class="main-section" id="building_new_establishments_and_completing_landmarks"><header><h1>BUILDING NEW ESTABLISHMENTS AND COMPLETING LANDMARKS</h1></header>
    <p>To conclude a player's turn, he or she may pay to construct one single Establishment card or pay to finish construction on a single Landmark by paying the cost shown on the lower left-hand corner of the card.</p>
    <p>Once constructed, an Establishment is taken from the supply and added to the player's play area. When constructing a Landmark, the Landmark card is turned right-side up (full-color side) and the Landmark's effects are now active.</p>
    <p>Landmarks may be constructed in any order the player chooses.</p>
    <p>Players may not construct more than one of each type of card with the <img class="tower" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dsevnfvxp/image/upload/v1542262247/Establishment_Symbol.png" alt="Establishment Image"><!--tower symbol--> in their town. A player may construct as many unique <img class="tower" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dsevnfvxp/image/upload/v1542262247/Establishment_Symbol.png" alt="Establishment Image"><!--tower symbol--> cards as they choose, but may never construct a second of the same <img class="tower" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dsevnfvxp/image/upload/v1542262247/Establishment_Symbol.png" alt="Establishment Image"> <!--tower symbol-->card.</p>
    <p>Players may construct multiple copies of all other Establishment types as described in the Earn Income section of these rules. Stacking cards of the same type vertically one on top of another in the player's area may be a useful way to keep track of this.</p>

    <header><h1>NOTES ON THE ESTABLISHMENTS</h1></header>
    <h3>Harbor</h3>
      <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dsevnfvxp/image/upload/v1542262250/Notes_-_Harbor.png" alt="Notes on Harbor" width="40%" style="max-width:300px;float:right;clear:right;padding:15px;border-radius:20px;">
      <p>If the dice total 10 or more, you have the option to add 2 to the total die roll if you choose. You cannot add just 1. This will affect the total of the die roll for all players and their Establishments, as well as your own. You can only choose to apply the effects of the Harbor on your turn; you cannot raise the value of another player's die roll.</p>
    
    <h3>Tax Office</h3>
      <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dsevnfvxp/image/upload/v1542262252/Notes_-_Tax_Office.png" alt="Notes on Tax Office" width="40%" style="max-width:300px;float:right;clear:right;padding:15px;border-radius:20px;">
      <p>You get half the amount rounded down. Which means the player who gives you money retains half rounded up.</p>
      <code><i>Example:</i> A player who has 21 coins pays 10 and keeps 11.</code>
      
    <h3>Flower Shop</h3>
      <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dsevnfvxp/image/upload/v1542262250/Notes_-_Flower_Shop.png" alt="Notes on Flower Shop" width="40%" style="max-width:300px;float:right;clear:right;padding:15px;border-radius:20px;">
      <p>With the effect of the Shopping Mall, the Flower Shop causes you to get 2 coins per Flower Orchard you have.</p>
      
      <code><i>Example:</i> If you have a constructed Shopping Mall, 3 Flower Orchards and 2 Flower Shops, you would receive 12 coins from the bank because your Flower Shops receive 2 coins for each Flower Orchard due to the Shopping Mall.</code>
    <h3>Tuna Boat</h3>
      <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dsevnfvxp/image/upload/v1542262253/Notes_-_Tuna_Boat.png" alt="Notes on Tuna Boat" width="40%" style="max-width:300px;float:right;clear:right;padding:15px;border-radius:20px;">
      <p>The dice rolled to determine income for the Tuna Boat do not affect and are not affected by any other Landmark or Establishment. The roll does not activate anything, including the Amusement Park on a roll of doubles. You only make this roll once, even if you have several Tuna Boats.<p>
      <code><i>Example:</i> You have 3 Tuna Boats. If the income roll was 8, you will gain 24 coins (8x3). Other players who have a finished Harbor will also get 8 coins per Tuna Boat.</code>
    <h3>Moving Company</h3>
    <div class="float-images">
      <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dsevnfvxp/image/upload/v1542262251/Notes_-_Moving_Company.png" alt="Moving Company Image" width="40%" style="max-width:120px;float:right;clear:right;padding:15px;border-radius:30px;">
      <p>When the Moving Company activates, you have to give another player one of your non <img class="tower" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dsevnfvxp/image/upload/v1542262247/Establishment_Symbol.png" alt="Establishment Image"><!--tower symbol--> Establishments. Which Establishment you choose to give and to whom is up to you.</p>
      <code><i>Note:</i> The Moving Company <b>can</b> be given to other players.</code>
      </div>
    <h3>Tech Startup</h3>
      <div class="float-images">
      <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dsevnfvxp/image/upload/v1542262252/Notes_-_Tech_Startup.png" alt="Tech Startup Image" width="40%" style="max-width:120px;float:right;clear:right;padding:15px;border-radius:30px;">
      <p>At the end of every turn (after you've constructed the Tech Startup) you may place 1 coin from your supply onto this card. When this card is activated, all players must pay you coins equal to the number of coins on this card. Avtivating the Tech Startup card does not remove any coins from it.</p>
      <code><i>Note:</i> You can never retrieve money that has been placed on the Tech Startup. Once you've invested it you cannot use the money to buy Establishments or pay other players if you owe them money.</code>
